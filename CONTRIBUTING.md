# CONTRIBUTING

This schema is developed by the [Cloud Work Stream](https://ga4gh.cloud) of the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](https://ga4gh.org).

## Semantic Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for WES, this will determine if you proposed changes impact a major or minor release.

## Suggesting Changes

Suggested changes to this schema can be initiated as Issues or Pull Requests to allow for discussion and review. Even those with write access to the main repository should in general create pull request branches within their own forks. This way when the main repository is forked again, the new fork is created with a minimum of extraneous volatile branches.

If a security vulnerability is identified with the specification please send an email to security-notification@ga4gh.org detailing your concerns.

## Approving Changes

### pre-WES v1.0.0 / Testbed Voting Procedure
Changes for the release are to be approved by four developers - Marcus Kinsella (HCA), Jeff Gentry (Broad Institute), James Eddy (Sage Bionetworks), Peter Amstutz (Veritas Genetics). In addition they must not be overridden by the Cloud Work Stream Leads, Brian O'Connor and David Glazer.

### post WES v1.0.0 Voting Procedure
GA4GH has a number of Driver Projects. Each of those associated with the Cloud Work Stream will nominate a representative. None of these may vote against a proposed change for it to proceed. In addition they must not be overridden by the Cloud Work Stream Leads, Brian O'Connor and David Glazer.
