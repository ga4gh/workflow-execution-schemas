    description: >-
      This endpoint describes the structure of workflow's inputs as a json schema. Consumers of this endpoint can use the generated schema to properly format their `workflow_params` when submitting a new run.

      The `workflow_attachment` array may be used to upload the primary workflow and other files referenced by the workflow.

      The `workflow_url` is either an absolute URL to a workflow file that is accessible by the WES endpoint, or a relative URL corresponding to one of the files attached using `workflow_attachment`.
